Role to install OpenSCAP.

The [Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP)](http://scap.nist.gov/) is a U.S. standard maintained by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). SCAP provides a specification for system for vulnerability detetection and remediation.

SCAP supports the process of FISMA Compliance, and the [National Vulnerability Database (NVD)](http://nvd.nist.gov/) is the U.S. government content repository for SCAP.

[OpenSCAP](https://www.open-scap.org/) implements the standard and was awarded "SCAP 1.2 certification" by NIST in 2014. It is a project created abnd supported by Red Hat and as such, has tradtionally been focused on the Red Hat (and CentOS) operating systems. But it is a flexible, open standard (if a bit obscure) and it's use across other platforms and applications is growing.

To make OpenSCAP easier/more manageable to use, see the [GovReady toolkit role](https://galaxy.ansible.com/openprivacy/govready/).
